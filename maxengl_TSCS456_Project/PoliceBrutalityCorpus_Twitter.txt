Why does Trump lie about things that can easily be fact checked? Trump lied about giving Mattis his nickname "Mad Dog". And Mattis resigned in protest over Trump‚Äôs Syria withdrawal. Trump did not fire Mattis. https://t.co/2vuJsYv0Rv|ENDOFTWEET|#Antifaexposed More good work from #ProjectVeritas https://t.co/QzHPomzqUr|ENDOFTWEET|@JamesOKeefeIII @Project_Veritas WARNING:  This ANTIFA footage took place in Paris and is very disturbing.
