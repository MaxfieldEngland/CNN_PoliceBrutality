# CNN_PoliceBrutality
Class project: analyzing a collection of tweets for sentiment analysis on the topic of police brutality around June 2020.

Compares VADER, CNN, MCP for tweet sentiment: rated between positive, neutral, and negative, based on the tone of the tweet and the language used. Since the tweets were not manually rated by hand, VADER is used as a 'control' for this project; in actuality, this analysis may be better seen as a measure of how well MCP and CNN models mimic the VADER model of NLTK particularly under the guise of the topic of police brutality in an incredibly divisive time.
